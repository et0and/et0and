My name is Tom, and I am an ex-teacher currently working on different web projects in P≈çneke, New Zealand.
I am interested in:
- making the web more accessible
- making the web more decentralised (protocols over platforms)
- supporting the growth of an ["indie web"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndieWeb)
- learning by doing
